                    <p>
                        This article aims to investigate the Grand Challenges which arise in the
                        current and emerging landscape of rapid technological evolution
                        towards more intelligent interactive technologies, coupled with
                        increased and widened societal needs, as well as individual and
                        collective expectations that HCI, as a discipline, is called upon to address.
                        A perspective oriented to humane and social values is adopted,
                        formulating the challenges in terms of the impact of emerging intelligent
                        interactive technologies on human life both at the individual and societal
                        levels. Seven Grand Challenges are identified and presented in this
                        article: Human-Technology Symbiosis; Human-Environment Interactions;
                        Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well-being, Health and Eudaimonia;
                        Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning and Creativity; and Social
                        Organization and Democracy. Although not exhaustive, they summarize
                        the views and research priorities of an international interdisciplinary
                        group of experts, reflecting different scientific perspectives,
                        methodological approaches and application domains. Each identified
                        Grand Challenge is analyzed in terms of: concept and problem definition;
                        main research issues involved and state of the art; and associated
                        emerging requirements.

                        Challenges,</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Speech interfaces are growing in popularity. Through a review of 99
                        research papers this work maps the trends, themes, findings and
                        methods of empirical research on speech interfaces in the field of
                        human–computer interaction (HCI). We find that studies are
                        usability/theory-focused or explore wider system experiences, 
                        evaluating Wizard of Oz, prototypes or developed systems. Measuring
                        task and interaction was common, as was using self-report
                        questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A
                        thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on
                        nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality
                        comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems,
                        assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using
                        speech technology for development, peoples’ experiences with
                        intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech
                        interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and
                        challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological
                        advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface
                        interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and
                        expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as
                        to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve
                        measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and
                        reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for
                        research.<br>

                        use of activity theory in HCI research</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        This paper reports a study of the use of activity theory in human–
                        computer interaction (HCI) research. We analyse activity theory in HCI
                        since its first appearance about 25 years ago. Through an analysis and
                        meta-synthesis of 109 selected HCI activity theory papers, we created a
                        taxonomy of 5 different ways of using activity theory: (1) analysing
                        unique features, principles, and problematic aspects of the theory; (2)
                        identifying domain-specific requirements for new theoretical tools; (3)
                        developing new conceptual accounts of issues in the field of HCI; (4)
                        guiding and supporting empirical analyses of HCI phenomena; and (5)
                        providing new design illustrations, claims, and guidelines. We conclude
                        that HCI researchers are not only users of imported theory, but also
                        theory-makers who adapt and develop theory for different purposes.

                    <p>
                        HCI has a complex and often ambivalent attitude towards the issue of
                        gender and interactive systems. Here I discuss three dominant
                        paradigms for treating gender in HCI, and discuss their limitations. Next,
                        I will present the theoretical perspectives on gender which are on the
                        fringes of HCI - Technology as Masculine Culture, Gender Positionality,
                        and Lived Body Experience - and discuss their possible contributions. I
                        will show how this supports a reassessment of the use of gender theory
                        in technological settings and its relevance for framing questions of
                        gender in HCI. My goal in doing so is to argue for the importance of a
                        more direct treatment of gender in HCI and move towards a feminist
                        theory for HCI.

                        impacts on the human-computer interaction (HCI). It is now possible to

                    <p>
                        Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) is a subfield of facial recognition
                        that aims to algorithmically identify the gender of individuals from
                        photographs or videos. In wider society the technology has proposed
                        applications in physical access control, data analytics and advertising.
                        Within academia, it is already used in the field of Human-Computer
                        Interaction (HCI) to analyse social media usage. Given the long-running
                        critiques of HCI for failing to consider and include transgender (trans)
                        perspectives in research, and the potential implications of AGR for trans
                        people if deployed, I sought to understand how AGR and HCI understand
                        the term "gender", and how HCI describes and deploys gender
                        recognition technology. Using a content analysis of papers from both
                        fields, I show that AGR consistently operationalises gender in a transexclusive
                        way, and consequently carries disproportionate risk for trans
                        people subject to it. In addition, I use the dearth of discussion of this in
                        HCI papers that apply AGR to discuss how HCI operationalises gender,
                        and the implications that this has for the field’s research. I conclude with
                        recommendations for alternatives to AGR, and some ideas for how HCI
                        can work towards a more effective and trans-inclusive treatment of
                        gender.
