                        This quiz is supposed to serve the students of the HMI lecture as a tool for revision. Furthermore, it is a guidance for the students 
                        to decide which topics still need some attention from them.

                    <h2 id="1">1 Methodological Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                        The aim of this project is <b>to develop a quiz that helps to revise the topics and contents of the Human Machine Interaction course</b>. 
                        Our group’s first idea was to develop a Kahoot quiz with questions referring to the class. Soon however, it became clear that the 
                        possibilities of designing a quiz Kahoot were insufficient. The only quiz design options of this tool are multiple choice and yes 
                        or no questions. We aimed for a bigger variety in methodology as working through a 30-45min quiz with only one learning methodology 
                        can be quite tiring. After a brainstorm session, our group decided to include fill-in-the-blank texts, timelines, associations and 
                        many more kinds into our quiz. This way, the player will have a varied and exciting experience while playing. Moreover, our group 
                        wanted to address as many senses as possible. As learned in the HMI lecture, the sense of vision delivers the highest percentage 
                        of data to the human brain. Therefore, the quiz contains not only plain text, but also many pictures and a video. Using this 
                        approach, the eye is stimulated in different ways. Following vision, the smell is the next sense but obviously we were not able 
                        to include that sense in the quiz. The same applies of course to the senses touch and taste. However, our group was able to include 
                        the third strongest sense: hearing. In one of the quizzes there is a voice reading the hints, if one hovers over them. As an 
                        example, have a look at the quiz Laws of Perception in topic 05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To have access to all those possibilities our group used the website learningapps.org to design all the different panel games. 
                        To aggregate the different quizzes <b>we decided to design an own website</b>. Considering the fact that a major part of our study 
                        program focuses on computer science, this seems to be appropriate. On the website, the quizzes are allocated to the different 
                        topics that the lecture covered, so that the students not only have the possibility to revise the whole class as one, but 
                        furthermore have the flexibility to revise one topic in particular. After finishing the whole or only a segment of the quiz, 
                        the player should be able to assess his or her own knowledge level. This way the quiz is a decision guidance for the student 
                        to decide, if he needs to revise a/multiple topic(s) or not. 
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="2">2 Instruction to the Material</h2>
                    <p>
                        As said above, the quiz is designed as a website. There are two options of accessing it. Either by following the link provided 
                        by our group or by clicking on the .html document. Having opened the website, the player can navigate as usual on it. It is 
                        arranged by the different lectures and within the lectures by the topics. By clicking on a topic, the appropriate quizzes open. 
                        When clicking on a quiz it will open on the website and is ready to be played! After completing a level, the user can navigate 
                        back to the other levels or topics. The whole time the user does not have to leave the website, but can rather enjoy all of 
                        the quizzes in one unified environment.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="3">3 Focus Topics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The quiz covers the whole content of the Human Machine Interaction lecture, thus it is not possible to display all the contents 
                        here in the 5 pages documentation. Rather, this paper focuses on the following three topics and gives a bit more background to 
                        them. These topics seemed especially appealing and interesting to the group and range from our entry point into the lecture to 
                        the end of it.

                    <h3 id="3.1">3.1 Why bother with Design: Norman Doors</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first quiz is about matching pictures of doors with a respective action (e.g. push). It is supposed to exemplify how successful 
                        design directly conveys the purpose of an object. As every user should be able to match the elements correctly, the quiz constitutes a 
                        good introduction to the topic. It works as a contrast to the following text about Norman Doors. Moreover, the easiness of the task 
                        provides a first sense of achievement that motivates to continue solving the other quizzes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fill-in-the-blank text has the purpose of providing a more detailed introduction to the topic of design. Moreover, it introduces 
                        the Norman Doors. After dealing with graphical input, the player now has to focus on carefully reading textual information. She/he is 
                        able to choose between words in a dropdown menu. This causes the player to re-read every excerpt of the text multiple times. Consequently, 
                        the reader will have a clearer understanding of the content. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        esign is often regarded as something optional, sometimes even as obsolete. It is nice to have but not essential. This common opinion is a 
                        widespread misconception. Designing is not simply about randomly choosing between colours and fonts, it is a major factor influencing the 
                        usability of an object. Ultimately, successful design is a crucial component of a good product. Unfortunately, users often only notice 
                        design when it fails. Successful design is often taken for granted. This might be the reason why the field itself does not possess the 
                        reputation of being crucial. Good design solves problems while poor design causes problems and frustration. Designers must have in mind that their target 
                        group does not consist of other designers or people with an engineering degree. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to emphasize the importance of design, it is easier to start off by having a look at failed design. In technical literature, a 
                        common example is the so-called Norman Door. These doors have one decisive attribute: it is not evident whether to push or pull them in 
                        order to pass. It can only be found out by guessing. Generally, ‘Norman Door’ is an umbrella term for poorly designed objects. These 
                        objects give no indication of how to use them. They require a manual or finding it out by trial and error. Norman Doors are negative 
                        examples of how to design objects or rather the User Interface (UI) of an item. Well-designed objects do not demand any previous knowledge 
                        on how to use them. In the case of doors, this means that there is no need for symbols or inscriptions. Optimally, someone who has no 
                        pre-experience and little technical understanding can handle the object. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This leads us to the most important principles of design. If one follows them, the designed object is likely to have a good user experience. 
                        Visibility states that all elements crucial for the usage of an object need to be visible from the first moment on while not destructing the 
                        aesthetics. Another aspect of visibility is that the system constantly informs the person using it what is currently going on. The main idea 
                        of Mappings is that every part of an object somehow directly conveys what it is used for by its design. Scissors are a typical example for 
                        mapping: the two holes directly indicate that one has to enter their fingers through them in order to utilize the scissors. Affordance 
                        connects the design and haptics of objects with their use. The user must understand all functionalities by simply looking at the object. 
                        Constraints limit the possible interactions and therefore simplify the usage of an object. Scissors can be used as an example again: the 
                        size of the holes indicate that one is supposed to only use one finger. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="3.2">3.2 Sensation vs. Perception</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sensation, Perception and optical illusions are very fascinating topics. Thus, the group chose to devote one of our focus topics to it. 
                        Furthermore, the eponymous quiz gives some insights into the different laws of illusion. Inside the quiz, the player needs to match the 
                        laws to the appropriate example picture. In case the player does not remember the definition of a certain law he/she has the opportunity 
                        to hover over the information sign on the law cards and the definition will be visible as a text and read out by a female voice. This way 
                        the visual and auditory sense is addressed. Furthermore, it is an easy and fun quiz, which only takes a few minutes but revises very important topics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But why can those illusions trick us? First, let’s have a look at how sensation works. Sensation is the strictly physical process of reception 
                        of stimuli. In literature, it is often compared to the camera obscura. That is because scientists used to draw a connection between the camera 
                        obscura and the eye. The camera obscura could produce an image with a lens and this functionality can be compared to our eye (<a href="Gregory.1998">cf. Gregory, 1998, p.34</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When light, reflected from an object, falls into the pupil it is focused by the lens and then falls onto the retina at the back of our eye. The 
                        light stimulates the nerve cells in the retina and the acquired data (electrical signals) is sent to the brain via the optic nerve, where it is 
                        analyzed and an image forms (<a href="#NationalEyeInstitute.2019">National Eye Institute, 2019</a>). Until this point the process is objective, but now the image gets interpreted by the 
                        brain and this happens subjectively. That is what is called perception. This means including prior knowledge, experiences etc. into the interpretation. 
                        Depending on their perception people make decisions or take actions. The subjectivity of perception explains why people might make different decisions 
                        after they have seen the same thing.<br> 
                        Moreover, the human perception can be tricked by illusions. That is the case when the perception differs from the objective sensation, thus from the truth 
                        (<a href="Gregory.1998">cf. Gregory, 1998 p. 194</a>). The reason why humans can be tricked by illusions is that their brain is trying to get the best result from the interference 
                        of input of the eye and the prior knowledge. This can be explained with the Ponzo illusion, which basically looks like a train track with two horizontal lines. 
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/Ponzo_Illusion.jpg">
                        <figcaption><b>Figure 1:</b> Ponzo Illusion (<a href="#Glasgow">University of Glasgow, n.d.</a>)</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Those two horizontal yellow lines are of the same length but the brain interprets them as being of unequal length. The picture gives the impression 
                        of depth. Thanks to their prior knowledge people know that on a train track all horizontal bars are of the same length and if the front bar now is 
                        not wide enough to reach the vertical bars it must logically be shorter than the one in the back. 
                        This is a good example of how our prior knowledge can influence our perception. The eye has delivered the raw data, where the bars are of the same length, 
                        but this was illogical for our brain, thus we perceived it differently.

                    </p>
                    <h3 id="3.3">3.3 Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The short interview with robot Sophia in Level 1 of the topic 12 is a good starting point into the topic. The video is a nice alternation of methodology 
                        and represents the approach of the group. The interview shows how incredibly far science is with developing human like robots, but also raises some 
                        concerns. It might even shock some people that Sophia is able to learn on her own. The developers have the ambition to act with humans like they were 
                        friends. This statement should let the player recall the topic of our discussion in HMI: Should robots be treated as a machine or colleague? That is 
                        exactly where the second quiz dives in deeper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a lot of research going on in the field of HRI and a lot of different perspectives on the topic. Sophia surely raises a lot of concerns, 
                        but on the other hand also fascinates. As she states herself, her goal is “to help people in real uses like medicine and education“ (<a href="#Hanson.2020">Hanson Robotics, 2020</a>). 
                        Furthermore, her purpose is to serve AI and HRI research. The goal is to have her live side-by-side with humans and let them connect to work for a 
                        better world (<a href="#Hanson.2020">cf. Hanson Robotics, 2020</a>). This sounds like a nice goal, but is her existence really as harmless as described? As one can imagine she provokes a 
                        lot of discussion especially regarding ethics. Probably, everyone has to come to an own conclusion. We will see in the future where this development is 
                        going. The annual International Conference of Human Robot Interaction always presents the latest finding on that topic.
