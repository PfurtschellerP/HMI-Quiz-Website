                    <p>
                        The aim of this project is <b>to develop a Quiz that helps to revise the topics and contents of the Human Machine Interaction Lecture</b>. 
                        The groups first idea was to develop a Kahoot quiz with questions referring to the class. Soon it became clear, that the possibilities 
                        of quiz design in Kahoot were insufficient. The only quiz design options of that tool are multiple choice and yes or no questions. The 
                        group aimed for a bigger variety in methodology as working through a 30-45min quiz with only one learning methodology can be quite tiring. 
                        After a brainstorm session the group decided to include fill-in-the-blank texts, timelines, associations and many more into their quiz. 
                        This way the player will have a varied and exciting experience while playing the quiz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the group decided to design an <b>own website with the above-mentioned quizzes</b>. They are divided into the different topics, that the 
                        lecture covered so that the students not only have the possibility to revise the whole class as one, but furthermore have the flexibility to revise 
                        one topic in particular. After finishing the whole or only a segment of the quiz, the player should be able to assess his own knowledge level. 
                        This way the quiz is a decision guidance for the student to decide, which and if he needs to revise a topic or not.

                    <h2 id="II">II. Instruction to the Material</h2>
                    <p>
                        As said above, our quiz is designed as a website even though it is not hosted online. By clicking on the html document, the website opens 
                        and the player can navigate as usual in it. It is arranged by the different lectures and within the lecture by the topics. By clicking on a 
                        topic, the appropriate quizzes open. When clicking on quiz it will open on the website and is ready to be played!
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="III">III. Focus Topics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The quiz covers the whole content from the Human Machine Interaction lecture, thus it is not possible to display all the contents here in 
                        the 5 pages documentation. Rather, this paper focuses on the following 3 topics and gives a bit more background to it.
